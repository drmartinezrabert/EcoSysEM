## Data README. MERRA-2 reanalysis
### Info
The Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, 
Version 2 (MERRA-2) provides data beginning in 1980. It was introduced 
to replace the original MERRA dataset because of the advances made in 
the assimilation system that enable assimilation of modern hyperspectral 
radiance and microwave observations, along with GPS-Radio Occultation 
datasets. It also uses NASA's ozone profile observations that began in 
late 2004. Additional advances in both the GEOS model and the GSI 
assimilation system are included in MERRA-2. Spatial resolution remains 
about the same (about 50 km in the latitudinal direction) as in MERRA.
