## Data README. CAMS reanalysis
### Info
The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) provides continuous 
data and information on atmospheric composition, supporting a wide range 
of applications from air quality monitoring and forecasting to climate 
change assessment. It combines observations from satellites and in-situ 
measurements with sophisticated numerical models to provide consistent 
and quality-controlled data records. CAMS data typically encompasses 
global and regional analyses and forecasts of reactive gases, greenhouse 
gases (GHGs), aerosols, and stratospheric ozone. The data records span 
from approximately 2003 onwards for analyses and reanalyses, with 
forecast data available on a rolling basis.
